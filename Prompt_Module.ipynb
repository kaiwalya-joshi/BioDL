Clear communication with pt re what\\ns on the schedule for\\n   her during the day will be helpful.  She may take comfort in contact\\n   with family as well, and reminders that family can visit hospital\\n   whenever is convenient for them.

Preprocedural timeout\\n confirmed the patient's identity using three patient identifiers, as well as\\n the procedure to be performed.\\n\\n Using usual sterile technique, 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, palpatory\\n and fluoroscopic guidance, the right common femoral artery was accessed using\\n a 19-gauge needle.  An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was then advanced through the needle\\n into the abdominal aorta under fluoroscopic guidance.  Needle was exchanged\\n over the wire for a 5-French vascular sheath, which was then connected to a\\n continuous saline sidearm flush.  A 5-French C2 Cobra catheter was then\\n advanced over the wire into the abdominal aorta and the [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire removed.\\n The C2 catheter was then used to access the superior mesenteric artery.\\n Angiogram performed with power injection of the SMA in frontal projection\\n shows no active bleeding.\\n\\n The C2 catheter was then dislodged from the SMA and used to select the celiac\\n trunk.  Arteriogram of the celiac trunk show no definite active extravasation\\n of contrast.  A Renegade Hi-[**Last Name (un) **] microcatheter with 0.018 Transcend wire was\\n then advanced through the C2 catheter to selectively cannulate the\\n gastroduodenal artery (GDA).  Selective arteriography was performed through\\n the microcatheter in frontal, right anterior oblique, left anterior oblique,\\n and cranial right anterior oblique projections also showed no definite focus\\n of active extravasation.  However, small branches extending from the GDA were\\n identified which supplied the region containing several vascular clips which\\n were placed during endoscopic attempts to achieve hemostasis within the\\n bleeding duodenal bulb ulcer.  Given these radiographic findings and the\\n patient's clinical presentation, decision was then made to embolize the\\n gastroduodenal artery.\\n\\n The microcatheter was advanced further into the GDA.   Embolization of the GDA\\n was then performed by deployment of multiple microcoils through the\\n microcatheter, including two 2 mm x 2 cm and four 3 mm x 3 cm Hilal coils\\n within the mid-to-proximal GDA.  Injection of contrast through the\\n microcatheter immediately after coiling showed some flow of contrast material\\n into the GDA.  Therefore, Gelfoam slurry was prepared and then injected\\n through the microcatheter into the GDA.  However, by this time, the vessel had\\n thrombosed to the most proximal coil, and there was stasis of the Gelfoam\\n within the proximal GDA.\\n\\n The wires, catheters and sheath were then removed and hemostasis at the right\\n groin achieved by manual compression for 20 minutes.  Sterile dressing was\\n applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complication.\\n\\n IMPRESSION:\\n 1.
